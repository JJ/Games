# Why accessibility matters
Accessibility means avoiding unnecessary barriers that prevent people with a range of impairments from accessing or enjoying your output.

15% of the population are disabled, rising to 20% amongst casual gamers (PopCap). Other conditions that aren’t registered disabilities can also hit barriers. 14% of the adult population have a reading age of below 11 years old (NCES / BIS), 8% of males have red-green colour deficiency (AAO), and many people have temporary impairments such as a broken arm. Many more have situational impairments such as playing in a noisy room or in bright sunlight, and all players have different levels of ability – there’s no ‘typical gamer’.
